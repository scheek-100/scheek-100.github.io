                            and acting roles.</i></p>
                    <h2>Intro</h2>
                    <p>My love for David Bowie’s music began when I first saw the famous <a
                            href="https://youtu.be/29FDSXSG5RM?si=G6u4p3A37haDasei" target="blank"
                            rel="noopener">“tunnel song” scene</a> from the
                        2012 film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1659337/" target="blank" rel="noopener"><i>The
                                Perks of Being a Wallflower</i></a>. I remember frantically searching online for
                        the mysteriously dubbed “tunnel song” by the three main characters of the movie. This song
                        turned out to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Heroes%22_(David_Bowie_song)"
                            target="blank" rel="noopener"><b>“Heroes”</b></a> which was created by the gifted English
                        singer-songwriter, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Bowie" target="blank"
                            rel="noopener">David
                            Bowie</a>. Ever since I first listened to this song, I have immersed myself in learning more
                        about
                        David Bowie’s music, his influence in science fiction, and obscure messages derived from
                        some of
                        his most iconic repertoire.
                    </p>
                    <p>The late musician, who passed away on January 10th, 2016 due to losing his internal battle with
                        liver cancer, is one of the most iconic figures of the rock music genre. He experimented with
                        different forms of music genres outside of rock, known for famous songs such as <b>“Space
                            Oddity”</b>
                        and <b>“Life on Mars”</b>. Bowie was also one of the most talented songwriters of his time, and
                        one of
                        my favorite music artists.

                    <h3><b>Ziggy Stardust Persona</b></h3>
                    <p>David Bowie was known for his creation of characters for each album(s) consisting of
                        unconventional narratives released, with each song portrayed as chapters of an alter ego’s
                        existence. Some of Bowie’s most popular stage names and personas were Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin
                        Sane, Vince Taylor, and several others depending on the purpose of the music created.</p>
                    <p>Audiences were enthralled by Bowie’s 1972 album called The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and
                        the Spiders from Mars, which was created through the late singer’s collaboration with the
                        eclectic band, The Spiders from Mars. Bowie released some of his most popular space-centric
                        music on the album, including iconic songs such as “Moonage Daydream”, “Starman”, and the “Ziggy
                        Stardust” song reflecting the alter ego of the same name.</p>
                    <p>It was also the first and only album where audiences were able to see the life and “death” of
                        Ziggy Stardust, an androgynous alien persona who fell to Earth and became a rock star. This
                        persona was referenced for the main character in the 1976 film, The Man Who Fell to Earth as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>While short-lived, the Ziggy Stardust character remains one of the late musician’s most
                        influential personas of rock music and science fiction to this day.</p>

                    <h3><b>Life on Mars? (1971)</b></h3>
                    <p>One of my favorite songs from David Bowie is known as “Life on Mars?”, an influential musical
                        inverse of the beloved Frank Sinatra song, “My Way”. “Life on Mars” has been heavily used in
                        media for the soundtrack of the British series version, Life on Mars, the 2015 musical called
                        Lazarus, in the 2006 Factory Girl indie film, and other soundtracks.</p>
                    <p>The brilliant musician, Trent Reznor from NIN (Nine Inch Nails), and his frequent music
                        collaborator (Atticus Ross) created a cover version of the song in memory of Bowie for the 2019
                        HBO series, Watchmen.</p>
                    <h3><b>Space Oddity (1969)</b></h3>
                    <p>Another favorite space-themed song from David Bowie is called “Space Oddity”, which was released
                        and heavily advertised in conjunction with the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969. This
                        time also represented one of the most celebrated accomplishments of NASA’s existence, which was
                        landing humans on the moon for the first time in history.</p>
                    <p>The song is a personal story about an astronaut named Major Tom who experiences a mechanical
                        malfunction, and whose fate correlates with the end of the “Space Race” era. Its melody also
                        reflects a bittersweet message for its listeners, which stresses the importance of personal
                        connections with others in the limited time we have in our human existence.</p>

                    <h3><b>The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976)</b></h3>
                    <p>Based on the 1963 science fiction novel by Walter Tevis, the The Man Who Fell to Earth is a film
                        where Bowie plays Thomas, an androgynous alien (alter ego also known as Ziggy Stardust) whose
                        planet is in turmoil. His character later becomes engaged in joyful activities and discovers
                        different aspects of humanity along the way. Bowie’s main role in the movie later led
                        Oppenheimer director, Christopher Nolan, to eventually casting him as the character, Nickola
                        Tesla, in The Prestige (2006).</p>

                    <h3><b>Labyrinth (1986)</b></h3>
                    <p>Possibly the strangest role Bowie has been cast as has been Jareth the Goblin King in the amazing
                        eighties fantasy musical called Labyrinth. This eccentric fantasy film follows the protagonist,
                        Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) on a journey to save her brother when she is captured by the Goblin
                        King.</p>

                    <h3><b>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (1992)</b></h3>
                    <p>If you’re a fan of the beloved tv series, Twin Peaks, you are likely already aware of the prequel
                        film — also starring Bowie — called Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. While the film’s predecessor
                        focuses on odd supernatural crime mysteries investigated by FBI agent Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan),
                        the prequel film shows the final living days of the first main victim, Laura Palmer (Sheryl
                        Lee). David Bowie made a cameo appearance in the film. Despite the character’s purpose in the
                        film never being explained, it solidified Bowie’s popularity among sci-fi fans.</p>

                    <h3><b>“The Sandman” Comic Book Series (1989 — present)</b></h3>
                    <p>The Sandman comic book series was written in 1989 and later adapted by the well-renowned fantasy
                        writer, Neil Gaiman, in 2022 as a Netflix series of the same name. The comics are written in the
                        point-of-view of the character, Dream, one of seven Endless god-like beings in existence, who
                        goes on a journey to find out who planned his kidnapping and descent in power.</p>
                    <p>Neil Gaiman has openly mentioned his inspiration for The Sandman character, Lucifer, is David
                        Bowie. Some of Gaiman’s most recently adapted work includes American Gods, Good Omens, and other
                        critically-acclaimed novels and short stories.</p>
